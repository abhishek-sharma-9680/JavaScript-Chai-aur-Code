/*In JavaScript, the let keyword allows you to declare variables that are block-scoped, meaning the variable is limited to the block in which it is defined (e.g., inside a loop, function, or conditional). If you try to declare the same variable more than once using let within the same scope, you will get a syntax error because let does not allow re-declaration of the same variable in the same scope.

Example:
javascript
Copy code
let a = 10;
let a = 5; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
This rule exists to prevent potential bugs that could arise from accidentally redeclaring variables and to encourage cleaner, more predictable code.

var Keyword:
In contrast, the var keyword is function-scoped or globally-scoped if declared outside a function. When you declare a variable using var, you can redeclare the same variable within the same scope without throwing an error.

Example:
javascript
Copy code
var b = 10;
var b = 5; // No error, the value of 'b' is simply overwritten*/
